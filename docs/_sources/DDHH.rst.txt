Data for humanities
-------------------


1) Document markup languages

   - **ConTeXt** a TeX macro package that has a cleaner interface to control typography of the document while retaining LaTeX's structure-oriented approach

     - with separation of content and presentation, it can format XML text, ...

   - **EAD** (*Encoded Archival Description*)

   - ...



2) Citation

   - *Arts and Humanities Citation Index* (AHCI)

     - Machine-readable bibliographic record - MARC, RIS, BibTeX



3) Geospatial/geographical data

   - **GeoJSON** is a geospatial data interchange format based on *JavaScript Object Notation* (JSON).

   - **Leaflet** is an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly, cross-browser, interactive maps.

   - A Web Map Service (**WMS**) is a standard protocol for serving georeferenced map images over the Internet that are generated by a map server using data from a GIS database.
     
     - See also Web Feature Service (**WFS**)



Data formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^


.. _json-str:


JSON structure
==============

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and it is based on the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262. 
JSON is built on two structures, namely a collection of name/value pairs, and an ordered list of values. 

A JSON structure looks like:

.. code-block:: 

    Object {
            Identifier: Value

            Identifier: Array [

               Object {
                       Identifier: Value
              }

            ]

    }

Where an ``Identifier`` is delimited by quotes, and a ``Value`` can be a ``string``, a ``number``, ``"true"``, ``"false"``, ``"null"``, 
or an ``Array`` or another JSON ``Object`` as the above example.
