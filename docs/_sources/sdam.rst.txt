The ``sdam`` R package
======================


Package Description
-------------------


This package provides tools for performing analyses within Social Dynamics and complexity 
in the Ancient Mediterranean (`SDAM <https://sdam-au.github.io/sdam-au/>`_), which is a 
research group based at the `School of Culture and Society <https://cas.au.dk/>`_ at 
Aarhus University (AU).

* See :ref:`"SDAM project" in Digital Humanities <sdam-proj>`


|

Currently, it is possible with sdam to access data from the Epigraphic Database Heidelberg API
with ``get.edh()``, and the wrapper function ``get.edhw()`` as well. Most of the data is available 
in the dataset attached to the package, which is called ``EDH``.

* See :ref:`Epigraphic Database Heidelberg <EDH>` and :ref:`Epigraphic Networks using R <EDH-net>` for applications of these functions and use of this dataset. 


|

Besides, the ``request()`` function allows performing different types of HTTP requests to a cloud
repository like DEiC'S https://sciencedata.dk or another customized URL address.

* See :ref:`DEiC's sciencedata.dk <DEiC-sddk>` for applications of this function. 


|

Similarity by simple matching among column vectors is achieved by the ``simil()`` function in order
to make analyses of assemblages or artifacts. Note that this latter function still under early
development.

* See :ref:`Epigraphic Networks using R <EDH-net>` for applications of this function.
