***********************

User Acceptance Test or
<span data-acronym-label="UAT" data-acronym-form="singular+short">UAT</span>
is a type of testing performed by the Client to certify the system with
respect to the requirements that was agreed upon. This report is to
illustrate the application of
<span data-acronym-label="UAT" data-acronym-form="singular+short">UAT</span>
in developing, testing, and releasing a new or updated
<span class="sans-serif">R</span> package.

User Acceptance Test for R package release
------------------------------------------

In the DTAP process (development :math:`\to` test :math:`\to` acceptance :math:`\to` production),
which is part of a software development process, the release of a new
version of an <span class="sans-serif">R</span> package is at the final
step where the deployment needs to meet certain requirements. The
"acceptance" portion in this process comes from both *humans*
(developer and clients) and *machines* (a list of rules that the
software must conform). Of course, human testing involves machines as
well, and this distinction is made for referring to a systematic way of
testing.

Human testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The development of a software component on a local machine has folders
containing a set of functions in a structure like this

::

    FOLDER-BUILD
    FOLDER-PUB
    Batch file to build

where the testing of the software occurs in the three parts.

A set of <span class="sans-serif">R</span> functions are written in
`FOLDER-BUILD` with a version control, and then the functions are tested
manually in the <span class="sans-serif">R</span> console or other
environment. It is important at this stage that the test involves random
data, different data sets, and the extreme cases that the input data may
have like zeroes, empty arrays, etc. Once there is an acceptance from the developer, `FOLDER-PUB` hosts
a copy of the functions to publish and then the building with the `batch
file`.

The batch file has the instructions in a sequential list to build the
package that typically are <span class="sans-serif">R</span> core
functions to load files, write or recreate an object to a file, and the
creation of a skeleton for a new source package.

Once the package is built then comes the documentation of the functions
with files in a Latex format that conform the manual. The machine
testing, which comes afterwards, will check among other things whether
there is a correspondence or not between the script codes and the
documentation.


Machine testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

<span class="sans-serif">Rtools</span> allows performing a machine
testing of <span class="sans-serif">R</span> packages within the MS
Windows operating system. First the package is constructed as a tarball
file with the command line and by typing `R CMD build`. Then the `R CMD
check` performs different types of tests on this file based on pass/fail
results where "fail" involves errors, warnings, and notes. The option
``--as-cran`` applies the most strict rules on the package and allows a
successful submission for a publication on the CRAN repository whenever
there is any fail.

An example of a successful testing is in the ``.log`` file given as
appendix where the checking starts in the `DESCRIPTION` file with the
basic information about the package. Then there is also a testing of
things like whether the package can be loaded and unloaded, and
consistencies both in the code and the documentation including meta
data.


UAT for users in GitHub
-----------------------

As with machine testing, the acceptance tests among users of the
<span class="sans-serif">R</span> package should reveal as well a
straightforward yes/no or pass/fail results. This means that the user
should be able to download, install, uninstal, and run the software
without any errors.

Another important component of the user acceptance is counting with a
shared infrastructure that team members administer, use on a day-to-day
basis and can reflect on and implement for others. GitHub is not only a
git repository, but it is also a tool suitable for educational tasks
such as periodical reflection and implementation for others.

GitHub storages the information and it can be used as well as backup for
disaster recovery. In many cases GitHub is the place where the users
report bugs, and where ideally users should become developers of the
package as well.


UAT exercise
------------

1) Install the beta version of the package from GitHub plus dependencies into the R environment

2) Load the package and run the scripts of the `README.md` file

3) Run the program with different datasets
    
  - if an error occurs then consult the manual to fix the input data
    
  - if the data introduced conforms the requirements from the manual and the error remains then report the bug

A successful user acceptance test has no errors, and the user is willing
to use the package in his/her own work.
