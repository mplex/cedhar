2019
^^^^

Since September 2019, the collaborative digital tools we are using in the project with potential bottlenecks are:

- **Github** is a Git repository hosting service, an editor

  - is proprietary (since year 2018 is part of Microsoft Inc.)

- **Google Drive** is a file storage and synchronization service  

  - provided only 15 GB is free of charge

- **Slack** is a cloud-based team collaboration tool.

  - is proprietary

- **Trello** is a card-based project management tool.

  - is proprietary and it is just a component of Jira

- **Zotero** is a reference management software.

  - cannot handle book chapters

- **Jira** project mgmt. system with agile tables (like Trello)

  - ends being a reporting system

- **RStudio** is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R language

  - do we have a full control?



2020
^^^^

This year we start with:

- **ReadtheDocs** is a documentation repository using reStructuredText Markup Specification
   - needs documentation builder to work optimal

- **Sphinx** is a documentation builder (in Python? not C++) e.g. for ReadtheDocs 

   - Sphinx search engine is produced by *craigslist*
